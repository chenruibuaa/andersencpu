    // that 'this' can abort itself at its own convenience (Note: 'this' could be in the middle of modifying a data structure)
    //
    // READY_TO_COMMIT -> COMMITTING // 'this' is the highest priority iteration in the system (i.e. among all completed and running iterations and 
    // the pending active elements in the worklist) and is at the head of the rob
    //
    // READY_TO_COMMIT -> ABORTING // 'that' raised a conflict with 'this' after this has completed, 'that' calls abort on 'this' 
    //
    // ABORTING -> ABORT_DONE // ABORTING means the 'this' is going to perform its abort actions and release locks; after having performed the abort actions 
    // this goes into ABORT_DONE, but 'this' hasn't been removed from the rob yet

    // rob at this point

    // to the data structures) if it is in following states:
