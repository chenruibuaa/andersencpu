/**
 * Default implementation of a Galois object suitable for extension
 * by user code. It encodes the following policies:
 *  <ul>
 *   <li><i>unmonitored access:</i> object assumes that access is
 *       mediated externally (i.e., it is an error if two iterations
 *       access this object at the same time and at least one access
 *       is a "write")</li>
 *   <li><i>restore from copy:</i> rollback is implemented by restoring
 *       eager copies of the object</li>
 *  </ul>
 * <p>
 * If an algorithm/application guarantees doesn't exclusive access to these
 * objects already, consider using
 * {@link AbstractBaseObject} instead.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Likewise, if rollback is relatively frequent, consider implementing
 * restore via undo actions rather than restoring from copy, i.e.,
 * {@link AbstractNoUndoBaseObject}</p>
